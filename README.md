# deployment_notification_manager
Sends slack notifications in response to hijacks table updates


## Development Notes

Use a virtual environment for development
[Guide to do here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/)

### Dependencies
Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`
Use `python` version 3

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to run

```
python3 Slack.py
```

This will result in a message/notification being send to the `slack-bot-test` channel in our slack group.
You should be allowed into that channel now, if not ask for permission.
